      <h1>SereniTea Prototyping</h1>
      <p class = "adTypography">
        I was given the task to create a mental health app. I first did a competetive analysis comparing other mental health apps. I've compared the Apple Watch's Mindfulness, the app HeadSpace, and the app Finch. Then I made a sketch of what screens the mental health application would have, created an interactive paper prototype of the app, created a video prototype, and finally created a higher fidelity prototype on Figma.
      </p>
      <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
      <p class = "adTypography">
        I did a competetive analysis comparing three apps together to come up with an idea of how I want to layout my app. When testing out the apps I evaluated featutures such as Core Functionality, Feedback Mechanisms, Personalization, the UI, and User Interaction. I have made a table showing the strengths and weaknesses from some of the feedback based on my testing of the app. I would explore each tab and each feature the app has to offer. I've decided to take parts of the strengths of each app and take note of their weakness that I can improve and incorporate it in my app.
