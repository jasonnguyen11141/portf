    <h1>Usability Study</h1>
    <p class="adTypography">
      I conducted a usability study testing the website for Delta Airlines. Participants of this study will include those with different experience levels with the site. The purpose of this usability study is to assess the websites ability to support users in completing certain tasks with ease and efficiency. 
    </p>
    <p class="adTypography">
      Those tasks include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Book a flight from Detroit to Shanghai on a (select date), choose a seat in business class, complete the booking process and confirm the flight through Delta.</li>
      <li>
        Rent an SUV from Chicago O’hare International Airport(ORD) on a (select date) through Delta.
      </li>
      <li>
        Book a 4-5 star hotel reservation at any hotel from (select date) through Delta.
      </li>
      <li>
        Learn the travel requirements for the country of Vietnam through Delta's website.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="adTypography">
      The objective was to find any issues the user had nagivating, accessing the site and to test the efficiency of it. The usability study will take place online, wherever the user prefers as long as they have access to share their screen. 
    </p>
    <p class="adTypography">
      I've conducted two usability testing sessions where the participants were asked to complete all four tasks while thinking aloud. I've taken notes on each issue that the user had and have drawn conclusion the website could make to combat confusion between the user and the website. I've found four issues that Delta's website has, written an explaination behind the issue, the severity, and given a solution for this issue.

      <h3>U1 Usability Study</h3>

      <h3>U2 Usability Study</h3>
      <iframe width="720" height="490"" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bd6E4IZdmYw?si=PXL0or-nATHHem0U" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        The issue I have found was when the U1 was selecting wasn't sure which "class" they were selecting, the user selected a seat in main cabin instead of Comfort+. I suggested we change the color scheme of the seats as Comfort+ has a light blue color compared to Main Cabin's blue color. 
      </p>
      <p class="adTypography">
        Another issue I have found is that for both users when selecting a 4-5 star hotel, in the search results, the star rating isn't displayed until the user selects that hotel. A way to see the star ratings in the search results is to filter the search by selecting which star hotel the user wants. I suggested that Delta adds all star hotel ratings without having the user to use the filter option. 
      </p>
      <p class="adTypography">
        Overall, this was a fun experience for me to conduct the usability study. It was intersting to what is is like to run these studies and the amount of usability issues that can be found no matter how well done the final product is. This experience taught me how to conduct such interviews and that we can always add new iterations to a website.
