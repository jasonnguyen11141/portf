    <h1>Usability Study</h1>
    <p class="adTypography">
      I conducted a usability study testing the website for Delta Airlines. Participants of this study will include those with different experience levels with the site. The purpose of this usability study is to assess the websites ability to support users in completing certain tasks with ease and efficiency. 
    </p>
    <p class="adTypography">
      Those tasks include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Book a flight from Detroit to Shanghai on a (select date), choose a seat in business class, complete the booking process and confirm the flight through Delta.</li>
      <li>
        Rent an SUV from Chicago O’hare International Airport(ORD) on a (select date) through Delta.
      </li>
      <li>
        Book a 4-5 star hotel reservation at any hotel from (select date) through Delta.
      </li>
      <li>
        Learn the travel requirements for the country of Vietnam through Delta's website.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="adTypography">
      The objective was to find any issues the user had nagivating, accessing the site and to test the efficiency of it. The usability study will take place online, wherever the user prefers as long as they have access to share their screen. 
    </p>
    <p class="adTypography">
      I've conducted two usability testing sessions where the participants were asked to complete all four tasks while thinking aloud. I've taken notes on each issue that the user had and have drawn conclusion the website could make to combat confusion between the user and the website.
