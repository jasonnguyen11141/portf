        In our Affinity Diagram, we have two green notes labeled “Managing Privacy Online” and the other “How I View Privacy”. Our green label on the left of the Affinity Diagram “Managing Privacy Online”, the green label contains information on what these users do to keep their information safe. These users use features such as Keychain to store specific information when they need it, Two Factor Authentication to keep the user's accounts secure, etc. Users will use those features and applications for better security and for convenience. Our green label on the right of the Affinity Diagram “How I View Privacy” mentions the user's ideology behind privacy. The green label contains how users want to use and/or share their information, whether the users decide to be public online or to keep their information private for themselves or a select group of users they are comfortable with.

        When our team started creating the Affinity Diagram, it was a lot. There were a bunch of notes on the board that we had to read through. Each member split all of the notes, and we read them through and paired whatever notes we saw fit. At first, I skimmed through the notes, and I kept getting lost. There were a lot of notes on my screen, and as I read through a note, halfway through, I would jump to another debriefing note. As I kept re-reading the debriefing notes given, I was able to match certain notes to each other because they both relate to each other. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When we got to the blue notes, it was difficult to try not to match two notes together that had the same user answering one question or having consecutive debriefing notes. One note I remember from a user is that we’re very similar, and we originally grouped from User 2 talking about Discord and the features that came with it. The notes mention how Discord allows users to join specific Discord channels to talk with friends. When we were finalizing our blue notes, reading through the notes, we saw the issue of those notes being in the same group, and moved one of them to a group that related more to that specific note. 
      </p>
      <p>
        During the blue note process, it was really easy to communicate with the team members. Everyone in the team remembers what blue notes they have created. Since everyone in the team remembers, it makes communicating much easier. Whenever I asked a team member about a specific note I was struggling with, I’d read it out loud, and they pointed me in the direction of where that grouping would belong. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We created 9 pink notes, and each pink note had 3-4 blue notes. Creating these pink notes was a bit difficult since we noticed that we had created some that basically had the same or similar title as the blue, causing us to rewrite either the pink or blue note. The day we worked on the pink notes, a couple of members of our team were missing, making it even more difficult for and group. We didn’t get enough feedback from other members on the pink notes, which made me question whether the pink notes are viable or not. Eventually, I read through the pink notes with the other notes, and I became confident with the placement of our notes. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I like the way our Affinity Diagram turned out. Each green, pink, and blue notes are grouped well together, and they make it easier to get the point for each debriefing note. Overall, the process started slowly, and some difficulties were encountered through the groupings, but as we got more familiar with the notes, grouping was easier, faster, and made enough sense.
